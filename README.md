# Task 1: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

## Objective
Predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing campaign.

## Dataset
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification using Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix
- Model explainability using SHAP

## Results
- Random Forest achieved strong predictive performance
- SHAP analysis identified key influencing features such as age, job, and balance

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- shap

## Conclusion
The model effectively predicts customer subscription behavior and SHAP helps explain feature impact, making the solution interpretable and business-friendly.
